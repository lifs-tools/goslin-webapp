news.news[0].link = https://github.com/lifs-tools/goslin-webapp/releases/tag/v1.0.18
news.news[0].date = v1.0.18 - April 21st, 2020
news.news[0].title = Initial version published
news.news[0].content = Initial public release version of the Goslin web application. This release contains support for automatic linking of normalized lipid names to SwissLipids and LIPID MAPS&REG; entries. This requires preprocessing of a subset of the LIPID MAPS&REG; structure database (LMSD) and the SwissLipids 'lipids' database. Each lipid name and abbreviations thereof, if available, are parsed with the parser specific to the database and normalized. This normalized lipid name is the used as a dynamic lookup by the goslin web application to retrieve the matching entry URIs from the preprocessed database tables.

news.news[1].link = https://github.com/lifs-tools/goslin-webapp/releases/tag/v1.1.0
news.news[1].date = v1.1.0 - May 13th, 2020
news.news[1].title = Added masses, sum formulas and adducts
news.news[1].content = <p>This release adds support for mass and sum formula calculation for most lipid classes (please check <a href="/documentation#lipid-classes-supported-by-goslin-and-the-web-application">the lipid class table</a>) based on the neutral lipid. It also adds support for adducts within the Goslin and Goslin fragments grammars, currently limited to those supported by <a href="https://lifs.isas.de/lipidcreator" target="_blank">LipidCreator</a>. Thus, normalized lipid shorthand notation names, as provided <b>after translation with Goslin</b>, can now be combined with an adduct. Please note that adduct charges need to be explicit, thus '[M+H]+' needs to be provided as '[M+H]1+'. Adducts are also factored into the mass and sum formula calculations.</p><p>This release contains mappings for normalized lipid names to SwissLipids (updated May 15th, 2020) and LipidMaps (updated February 10th, 2020). The Goslin web application is <b>not</b> a meta search engine (yet).</p>

news.news[2].title = Maintenance update
news.news[2].content = <p>This release follows release <a href="https://github.com/lifs-tools/jgoslin/releases/tag/v1.1.2" target="_blank">1.1.2 of the jgoslin library</a>. It adds additional warnings whenever modifications are encountered. At the moment, only hydroxylations are properly accounted for within the mass and sum formula calculation. It also updates the jgoslin dependency to the latest release version 1.1.2.</p>
